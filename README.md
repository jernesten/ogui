# ogui - Google Drive Ocalmfuse Graphical User Interface
Linux Graphical user interface for GDrive ocamlfuse build in python3 - v. 1.4.21 Beta.

CC-BY-NC-SA - License

After days of confinement caused by the appearance of the "damn virus", I have decided to spend my time learning to program in python as a way to get something positive out of the situation, and to maintain my sanity despite being locked up for so long.
It is a small application that serves as a graphical interface to control the Ocalmfuse program write by Astrada and also shared in github.
https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse

The application allows you to manage more than one google drive account, according to the parameters defined for the ocamlfuse program.

Sorry if the code is not as fancy as python could allow, but this is my first python app. However I am open to suggestions if someone thinks they know how to improve it.
